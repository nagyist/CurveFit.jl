    CurveFitProblem(x, y; nlfunc=nothing, u0=nothing, sigma=nothing, lb=nothing, ub=nothing)

Represents a curve fitting problem where `x` and `y` are the data points to fit.

Certain algorithms may require an initial guess `u0` for the coefficients to fit. See
specific solver documentation for more details.

Weights can be passed through `sigma`, which should be an array with the same
dimensions as `y`. As with `curve_fit()` from scipy, the elements should be the
standard deviation of `y`. Note that currently `sigma` is not supported for all
kinds of fits, check the problem or algorithm docstring to see if sigma is
supported.

Lower and upper bounds on the parameters can be passed through `lb` and `ub`,
which should be arrays with the same length as `u0`. Note that currently
`bounds` is not supported for all kinds of fits, check the problem or algorithm
docstring to see if bounds are supported.

    NonlinearCurveFitProblem(f, u0, x, y=nothing, sigma=nothing; lb=nothing, ub=nothing)

Nonlinear curve fitting problem where `f` is a nonlinear function to fit, `u0` is the
initial guess for the coefficients, `x` and `y` are the data points to fit, and
`sigma` is the standard deviation associated with `y`. The following
optimization problem is solved:

```math
\argmin_u ~ \left\| f(u, x) - y \right\|_2
```

If `y` is `nothing`, then it is treated as a zero vector. `f` is a generic Julia function or
ideally a `NonlinearFunction` from [`SciMLBase.jl`](https://github.com/SciML/SciMLBase.jl).

Lower and upper bounds on the parameters can be passed through `lb` and `ub` keyword
arguments. These should be arrays with the same length as `u0`.

## Function Signature

The model function `f` should have the signature `f(params, x)` where:
- `params` is a vector of parameters to be fitted
- `x` is the input data (can be a vector or matrix)

The function should return predictions for all input data points. For vectorized operations
over arrays, use Julia's broadcasting syntax with the `@.` macro:

```julia
# Vectorized function using @.
fn(a, x) = @. a[1] + a[2] * x^a[3]
```

For users who prefer to define scalar functions (e.g., those migrating from LsqFit.jl),
use the [`ScalarModel`](@ref) wrapper:

```julia
# Scalar function (operates on single x value)
fn_scalar(a, x) = a[1] + a[2] * x^a[3]
prob = NonlinearCurveFitProblem(ScalarModel(fn_scalar), u0, x, y)
```

See also [`ScalarModel`](@ref).

end
function NonlinearCurveFitProblem(f::F, u0, x, y = nothing, sigma = nothing; lb = nothing, ub = nothing) where {F}
    return NonlinearCurveFitProblem(NonlinearFunction(f), u0, x, y, sigma; lb, ub)
end

"""
    ScalarModel(f)

Wraps a scalar function `f(params, x_i)` that operates on a single data point `x_i`
into a vectorized form suitable for CurveFit.jl.

This is useful for users migrating from LsqFit.jl or those who prefer defining
scalar model functions without explicit broadcasting via the `@.` macro.

## Why is `@.` Typically Required?

In CurveFit.jl, model functions receive the entire data array `x` at once and must
return predictions for all data points. This vectorized design enables:
- Better GPU performance when using GPU arrays
- More efficient compilation with tools like Reactant.jl
- User control over array types

## Using ScalarModel

Instead of writing a vectorized function:
```julia
# Vectorized function (uses @.)
fn(a, x) = @. a[1] + a[2] * x^a[3]
prob = NonlinearCurveFitProblem(fn, u0, x, y)
```

You can write a simpler scalar function:
```julia
# Scalar function (no @. needed)
fn_scalar(a, x) = a[1] + a[2] * x^a[3]
prob = NonlinearCurveFitProblem(ScalarModel(fn_scalar), u0, x, y)
```

## Migration from LsqFit.jl

For users coming from LsqFit.jl, note that the parameter order is reversed:
- LsqFit.jl: `model(x, p)` (data first, then parameters)
- CurveFit.jl: `model(p, x)` (parameters first, then data)

Example migration:
```julia
# LsqFit.jl style (does NOT work directly)
lsqfit_model(x, p) = p[1] * exp(-x * p[2])

# CurveFit.jl with ScalarModel
curvefit_model(p, x) = p[1] * exp(-x * p[2])
prob = NonlinearCurveFitProblem(ScalarModel(curvefit_model), u0, x, y)
```

Represents a rational polynomial fitting algorithm with numerator degree `num_degree`
and denominator degree `den_degree`. The internal polynomial fitting algorithm is
determined by the `alg` keyword argument. If `alg` is `nothing` or a
`AbstractNonlinearAlgorithm` (like solvers from NonlinearSolve.jl), it will use a
nonlinear curve fitting approach. If `alg` is a `AbstractLinearAlgorithm`, it will use
linear least squares fitting. This algorithm does not support passing weights
through `sigma` in [`CurveFitProblem`](@ref).

## Linear Rational Polynomial Fitting

In this case the following curve fit is done:

```math
y = \\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}
```

where `p(x)` is a polynomial of degree `num_degree` and `q(x)` is a polynomial of degree
`den_degree`. The linear case is solved by doing a least squares fit on:

```math
y q(x) = p(x)
```

where the zero order term of `q(x)` is assumed to be 1.

## Nonlinear Rational Polynomial Fitting

If an `u0` is not provided to the problem, then we will use linear least squares for an
initial guess.

Uses numerical integration with `m` strips, where the default `m=1` uses linear
interpolation. `m=2` and higher require uniform interval and usually lead to better
accuracy.

# Changelog

This documents notable changes in CurveFit.jl. The format is based on [Keep a
Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com).

## [v1.4.1] - 2026-02-14

### Changed
- CurveFit now depends only on NonlinearSolveFirstOrder.jl to reduce
  dependencies ([#85]). The default algorithm remains the same.

## [v1.4.0] - 2026-01-31

### Added
- Implemented [`margin_error()`](@ref) ([#81]).
- Added support for standard deviation weights for linear fits ([#80]).

### Changed
- [`ScalarModel()`](@ref)'s will now operate in-place for improved performance
  ([#82]).

## [v1.3.0] - 2026-01-26

### Added
- Added support for standard deviation weights for nonlinear fits ([#79]).

### Changed
- **Breaking**: `reinit!(::GenericNonlinearCurveFitCache)` now takes in `u0` as
  a keyword argument rather than a positional argument for consistency with
  NonlinearSolve.jl ([#79]).

### Fixed
- Fixed `reinit!(::GenericNonlinearCurveFitCache)` to allow passing a new
  `x`/`y` as well as `u0` ([#79]).

## [v1.2.0] - 2026-01-21

### Added
- Implemented [`ScalarModel`](@ref) to allow using scalar functions as models
  ([#75]).
- Implemented `SciMLBase.successful_retcode()` for [`CurveFitSolution`](@ref)
  ([#78]).
